PyFBUploader README $Id$

== About ==

PyFBUploader is a Python script for uploading Photos using the Facebook Platform.
It attempts to make it easy to upload photos to your facebook albums from the shell.
It is compatible with Linux and probably any other POSIX compliant system.

== Usage ==

fbupload [list of files]

A list of albums will be presented.  Choose an album by typing its number.

You can use any shell file list expansion facilities that your shell supplies.

For example
	fbupload 20080517_00{1,4,7}.jpg
	fbupload jims_wedding_*

If it is your first time using the application, PyFBUploader will open a web browser
where you will be required to log into facebook.  After the first run, PyFBUploader
should be able to reuse its session.  The session is stored in ~/.pyfbuploader as
a file.

== Installation ==

You can use PyFBUploader locally, but it's preferable to install it.  Installation is 
very simple:

	make
	sudo make install

== Dependencies ==

PyFBUploader depends on only one library, PyFacebook (http://code.google.com/p/pyfacebook/).
As of May 18 2008, there are no releases.  PyFBUploader is tested to work with revision 127.

To get this version:

	svn co -r 127 http://pyfacebook.googlecode.com/svn/trunk pyfacebook
